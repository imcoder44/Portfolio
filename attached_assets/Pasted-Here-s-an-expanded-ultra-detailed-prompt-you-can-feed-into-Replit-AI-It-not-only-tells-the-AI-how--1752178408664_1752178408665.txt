Here’s an expanded, ultra‑detailed prompt you can feed into Replit AI. It not only tells the AI how to build the site, but **literally provides every piece of text** you want on each page—so you don’t have to supply any copy separately.

**🚀 Full Prompt for Replit AI**

````
You are a world‑class full‑stack developer and designer. Build me a **production‑ready**, **deployed** portfolio website in React (Vite or CRA) with Tailwind CSS. It must include smooth animations via Framer Motion (page transitions, hover effects, scroll reveals) and use creative layouts (diagonal section dividers, interactive timeline, 3D‑parallax hero). The site must be fully responsive and accessible. Use the following **exact text** and structure:

**Deployment Configuration**  
- Include `package.json` scripts:  
  ```json
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "serve": "serve -s dist"
  }
````

* Use Replit Secrets for any SMTP or API keys (e.g., EMAIL\_HOST, EMAIL\_USER, EMAIL\_PASS).
* Add `replit.nix` or `.replit` to install dependencies and run `npm run dev`.
* Ensure CORS and form‑handler endpoints work on the live URL.
* After generation, run “Deploy” on Replit to get a live link and add your custom domain.

Generate all components, pages, styles, config files, and a README with **exact setup and deploy instructions**. The site should render immediately on your Replit URL with zero additional edits. Good luck!
